coding logics to cover all concepts of C++
1. CLASS & OBJECTS
2. ENCAPSULATION 
3. ABSTRACTION 
4. CONSTRUCTORS & DESTRUCTORS
5. INHERITANCE __>>single >> multilevel >> multiple >> hierarchical >> hybrid__ or VIRTUAL INHERITANCE __>> multipath__
6. POLYMORPHISM __FUNCTION OVERLOADING >> OPERATOR OVERLOADING >> FUNCTION OVERRIDING >> VIRTUAL FUNCITONS__
>>__OBJECT__ is a smallest entity that has characteristics and behavior, and these objects hold variables of a class in accordance with the access specifiers. ​

OBJECT is an instance of a CLASS
>>__CLASS__ is a user defined data types that contains data members (variables) and member functions. ​

__When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated(object is created) memory is allocated.​__

__ABSTRACTION__

__ENCAPSULATION__
