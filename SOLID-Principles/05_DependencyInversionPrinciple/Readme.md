The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that 

**High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.** 

Additionally, 

- **Abstractions should not depend on details**; 
- **Details should depend on abstractions**. 
 
This principle encourages the use of interfaces or abstract classes to decouple high-level business logic from low-level implementation details.
