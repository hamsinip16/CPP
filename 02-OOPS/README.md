# C++ Object Oriented Programming

coding logics to cover all concepts of C++

# CLASS & OBJECTS
__OBJECT__ is a smallest entity that has characteristics and behavior, and these objects hold variables of a class in accordance with the access specifiers. ​
OBJECT is an instance of a CLASS
__CLASS__ is a user defined data types that contains data members (variables) and member functions. ​


# ENCAPSULATION 


# ABSTRACTION 


4. CONSTRUCTORS & DESTRUCTORS


5. INHERITANCE __>>single >> multilevel >> multiple >> hierarchical >> hybrid__ or VIRTUAL INHERITANCE __>> multipath__


6. POLYMORPHISM __FUNCTION OVERLOADING >> OPERATOR OVERLOADING >> FUNCTION OVERRIDING >> VIRTUAL FUNCITONS__

   

When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated(object is created) memory is allocated.​
>>__ABSTRACTION__ is the process of showing essential detailsto user while hiding unnecessary details. This avoids code duplication and increases reusability.

>>__ENCAPSULATION__ is the process of binding data members and functions together in a class as private, so they cannot be modified by external sources. External data is kept hidden using ACCESS SPECIFIERS.

>>__INHERITANCE__ allows methods & functions to inherit attributes of another class. This creates class hierarchy - Derived(child) class gets Base(parent) class behaviour & attributes.

>>__POLYMORPHISM__ allows a program to have different meaning and functions. A call to a member function will execute a different function depending upon the TYPE OF THE OBJECT that invokes the function.
