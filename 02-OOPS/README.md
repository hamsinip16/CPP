# C++ Object Oriented Programming


# CLASS & OBJECTS
__OBJECT__ is a smallest entity that has characteristics and behavior, and these objects hold variables of a class in accordance with the access specifiers. ​

__CLASS__ is a user defined data types that contains data members (variables) and member functions. ​
>>OBJECT is an instance of a CLASS

__When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated(object is created) memory is allocated.​__


# ENCAPSULATION 
It is the process of binding data members and functions together in a class as private, so they cannot be modified by external sources. External data is kept hidden using ACCESS SPECIFIERS - private, public, protected.
>> Unless specified, the default access specifier in C++ is __private__


# ABSTRACTION 
It is the process of showing essential details to the user while hiding unnecessary details. This avoids code duplication and increases reusability.
>> HEADERFILES:  function declarations and CPPFILES: function implementations


# CONSTRUCTORS & DESTRUCTORS


# INHERITANCE 
This concept allows methods & functions to inherit attributes of another class. This creates class hierarchy - Derived(child) class gets Base(parent) class behaviour & attributes.
__SINGLE INHERITANCE__ 

__MULTILEVEL INHERITANCE__

__MULTIPLE INHERITANCE__

__HIERARCHICAL INHERITANCE__

__HYBRID INHERITANCE__ 

__VIRTUAL INHERITANCE__

__MULTIPATH INHERITANCE__


# POLYMORPHISM 
This concept allows a program to have different meanings and functions. 
>>A call to a member function will execute a different function depending upon the TYPE OF THE OBJECT that invokes the function.

__FUNCTION OVERLOADING__ 

__OPERATOR OVERLOADING__ 

__FUNCTION OVERRIDING__

__OPERATOR OVERRIDING__ 

__VIRTUAL FUNCITONS__
