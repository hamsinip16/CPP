The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is one of the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. 
It states that **objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program**. 

In other words, 

**subclasses should extend the behavior of the superclass without changing its fundamental behavior.**
