# Design-Patterns
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices, evolved over time, and are a toolkit for software developers to solve common problems efficiently.

# Why are Design Patterns required?
__1. Solving Recurring Problems:__ Design patterns offer solutions to problems that occurs repeatedly. these patterns can be used as blueprints for solving common design issues.

__2. Facilitating Communication:__ Design patterns establishes a common set of terms that can be used to discuss design concepts for better understanding.

__3. Enhancing Code Reusability and Maintainability:__ Design patterns helps in creating code that is modular and easier to maintain without repeating the same code, saving time and effort.

__4. Improving Scalability:__ Design patterns incorporate principles that make it easier to scale applications. 

__5. Facilitating Best Practices:__ Design patterns are not arbitrary solutions. They encapsulate collective solutions that have been tested in real time scenarios.

>>Best Design Patterns to use : __Strategy pattern, Composite pattern__
Both provide means to achieve flexibility and modularity in software design, demonstrating the power of using well-defined design patterns in software development.
