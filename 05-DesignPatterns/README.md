# Design-Patterns
Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices, evolved over time, and are a toolkit for software developers to solve common problems efficiently.

Why Design Patterns Matter?

__1. Solving Recurring Problems:__ Design patterns offer solutions to problems that occurs repeatedly. these patterns can be used as blueprints for solving common design issues.

__2. Facilitating Communication:__ Design patterns establishes a common set of terms that can be used to discuss design concepts for better understanding.

__3. Enhancing Code Reusability and Maintainability:__ Design patterns helps in creating code that is modular and easier to maintain without repeating the same code, saving time and effort.

__4. Improving Scalability:__ Design patterns incorporate principles that make it easier to scale applications. 

__5. Facilitating Best Practices:__ Design patterns are not arbitrary solutions. They encapsulate collective solutions that have been tested in real time scenarios.


__Categories of Design Patterns__

__1. Creational Patterns:__ Simplify object creation. 
>> Builder >> Factory >> Factory Method >> Abstract Factory >> Prototype >> Singleton

__2. Structural Patterns:__ Deal with object composition.
>> Adapter >> Bridge >> Composite >> Decorator >> Facade >> Flyweight >> Proxy

__3. Behavioral Patterns:__ Handle communication between objects. 
>> Chain of Responsibility >> Command >> Interpreter >> Iterator >> Mediator >> Memento >> Observer >> State >> Strategy >> Template Method >> Visitor

__Best Design Patterns to use : Strategy pattern, composite pattern__
Both provide means to achieve flexibility and modularity in software design, demonstrating the power of using well-defined design patterns in software development.
