  # Data-Structures
A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. 
It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

1. __Linear Data Structure__

   --> STATIC DATA STRUCTURES

   >> __Array__ [fixed memory size]

   --> DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURES

   >> __Vector__
   
   >> __Queue__ [FIFO]
   
   >> __Stack__ [LIFO]
   
   >> __Linked List__ [to implement stacks, queues, graphs]

3. __Non-Linear Data Structure__

   --> TREE 

   --> GRAPH


__LINKED LISTS__  

Sequential data structure, data elements are linked to one another and can grown and shrink during run time.

>>PROS: efficiently utilizes memory >> insertion & deletion is easy at any position

>>CONS: accessing elements is time consuming >> more memory is required for big lists
